====================================
SaltStack States and Pillar Examples
====================================

Purpose:
--------

This repository is a proof-of-concept created in a test-environment with a simple master+minion SaltStack setup.

Notes:
------

I came from working with Puppet, so a lot of the bad Puppet habits learned using Puppet probably carry over into this repository. This is a work in progress, so hopefully I can salt-ify my mindset enough to fix any glaring issues between what "is" and what "should be".
